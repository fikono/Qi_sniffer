# Qi Sniffer
Avid Qi sniffer
- Manufactured By: AVID Technologies

The Sniffer is a USB device that can be placed near a Qi compliant wireless charging system (TX and RX pair) and used to capture the wireless communication packets and other system operating information. The Sniffer detects, demodulates, and decodes digital bi-phase communication data of either polarity and at different baud rates. A Windows graphical user interface application displays and logs the packets and other data captured by the Sniffer.  

The Qi Sniffer consists of a USB stick device and the Qi Development System application program. When the Sniffer is placed near a Qi transmitter (within 50 mm or about 2 inches), it will detect and capture wireless power interface information. The Qi Development System provides the user interface for the system and allows the captured data to be displayed and saved to a file.

- Note:  
Existing Qi Sniffer devices can be updated to add v1.1 compatability via the latest Application Program (requires upgrade key)

- Key Applications:   
Product Developers of Qi compliant products looking to quickly analyze and debug system operation, firmware operation, and validate timing parameters related to TX/RX detection and communication driven by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) specifications.
